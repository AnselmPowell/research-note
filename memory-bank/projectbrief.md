# Research Note - Project Brief

## Project Identity
**Mission**: Automate the discovery and extraction pipeline for academic research.
**Status**: Production deployed on Railway (v2).
**Target**: researchers, PhD students, and academic professionals.

## Core Requirements (Current)

### 1. Discovery
- Multi-modal search (Web + ArXiv + Direct Upload).
- AI intent modeling to optimize academic search terms.

### 2. Extraction
- Geometric PDF analysis for accurate 2-column text extraction.
- Semantic distillation to identify relevant findings.
- RAG-based extraction of quotes with justifications and citations.

### 3. Management
- Three-column responsive workspace.
- Hierarchical folder and note organization.
- Bi-directional linking between notes and PDF sources.

### 4. Intelligence
- Real-time AI research assistant with context access.
- Tool-calling for interacting with user notes.

## Success Metrics
- **Efficiency**: 80% reduction in time spent on literature reviews.
- **Accuracy**: 95% successful PDF processing and extraction.
- **Trust**: Reliable source attribution and real-time status feedback.

## Current Completion Status (v2)
- ✅ Production environment (Docker/Railway/Neon).
- ✅ Multi-provider AI pipeline (Gemini/OpenAI).
- ✅ Advanced PDF text reconstruction.
- ✅ Robust authentication and data migration.
- ✅ Refined UI/UX with "Scholar" design system.

## Out of Scope
- Native mobile applications (Web-responsive only).
- Document editing/writing (Synthesis focus only).
- Social networking features.
