# Product Context - Research Note

## Why Research Note Exists

### The Academic Efficiency Gap
Academic researchers currently waste ~60% of their time on "mechanical" research tasks: searching, downloading, CTRL+F searching within PDFs, and manual citation management. Research Note exists to automate these low-value tasks, allowing researchers to focus on synthesis and discovery.

### User Problems Solved
- **Source Fragmention**: Research is scattered across browser tabs and desktop folders.
- **Extraction Latency**: Manually finding specific findings in 50-page PDFs takes hours.
- **Citation Overhead**: Managing links between quotes and their precise source locations is error-prone.

## User Experience Goals

### 1. Research "Flow" Preservation
The interface minimizes context switching. Users can search the web, deep-dive into arXiv, read papers, and take organized notes within a single, unified three-column layout.

### 2. High-Trust AI Assistance
Unlike generic chatbots, the AI in Research Note is a **Transparent Assistant**:
- Always provides direct quotes from the source.
- Justifies why a specific note was extracted.
- Provides one-click navigation back to the original PDF page.

### 3. Integrated Workspace
- **Left Column**: Managed list of current research sources.
- **Middle Column**: AI-driven research results and extraction feed.
- **Right Column**: High-fidelity PDF viewer for deep reading and verification.

## Target User Personas
- **The Systematic Reviewer**: Needs to find every relevant paper on a specific medical/technical topic.
- **The Literature Synthesizer**: Needs to find specific evidence to support or refute a hypothesis.
- **The Student Researcher**: Needs help discovering the most relevant papers in a new field quickly.

## Design Philosophy
- **Professional Authority**: Clean, scholarly aesthetic using the "Scholar" color palette.
- **Clutter Reduction**: Progressive disclosure of features and removal of redundant buttons to focus on core actions.
- **Immediate Feedback**: Real-time status indicators (downloading, extracting) to keep the user informed of background AI work.
